# Exoplanets-Habitability
🌍 Exoplanet Habitability 

A machine learning-based project for predicting the potential habitability of exoplanets based on their observed features. The goal is to assist in prioritizing exoplanets for further observational studies in the search for potentially life-supporting worlds.
📖 Overview

With thousands of exoplanets discovered to date, determining which of these could harbor life is a key challenge in modern astrophysics. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify exoplanets as potentially habitable or non-habitable based on a variety of planetary and stellar parameters.

The project uses publicly available exoplanet datasets and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to make habitability predictions.

🪐 Data

The dataset used for this project includes observed features such as:

    Planetary mass

    Radius

    Orbital period

    Surface temperature

    Host star type

    Distance from host star (semi-major axis)

    Host star luminosity

The primary data source is NASA Exoplanet Archive / The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog.
